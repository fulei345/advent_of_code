Is a 2D traversal with obstacles
# Day 7: Bridge Repairz
Is a combinatoric, of operators on a list of numbers to get the result of that

# Day 8: Resonant Collinearity
2D map of radio nodes
There are some rules for where antinodes are 

# Day 9: Disk Fragmenter
You got to disk fragment to save space.
Part 1 just put them all in the beginning
Part 2 can be optimised with an hashmap of the next free space of a certain size

# Day 10: Hoof It
Find trails in a 2D map with heights
Find paths which has some rules
These are not very far since it it to 0-9

# Day 11: Plutonian Pebbles
Stones which multiply fast, there are a lot of repeats
Can be put into hashmap, and their transition
Do not save as string

# Day 12: Garden Groups
Graph problem, where some are more connected than others
In part 2 it is best to count corners

# Day 13: Claw Contraption
Button needs to be pressed a number of times to move claw.
Can be solved with math

# Day 14: Restroom Redoubt
A list of people and their velocity
A number of stebs see where they are
In part 2 find a pattern they make

# Day 15: Warehouse Woes
2D map with objects and a person
And a list of instruction on that person

# Day 16: Reindeer Maze
2D map where you are gonna find all the optimal paths for the race

# Day 17: Chronospatial Computer
3 Registers and a list of instruction which can loop
Part 2 find which input gives the same program

# Day 18: RAM Run
Ram is falling on a 2D square plane
We gotta find after a number of those bytes is falling what the optimal path is
And part 2 find when the paths gets cut off

# Day 19: Linen Layout
A combinations of lines material needs to be made to towels
Combination problem, we need to find out if they can be made with what we have
In Part 2 find all combinations of how we can make the towels

# Day 20: Race Condition
2D map where we race against a program
and we can disable collision for some time to save some time to the end
We need to find how many of those which saves us 100 or more
Eah jump who starts and ends the same place are the same121

# Day 21: Keypad Conundrum
We have some amount of robots which needs to press some buttons
They are chained and we need to press the last robot
Find the minimum steps for us to press on the robot

# Day 22 Monkey Market
We gets  a list of monkeys secret number and needs to generate their pseudorandom number
Then find their 2000 th pseudo number.
In part 2 we find which sequence of 4 differences in price gets the max bananas for our hiding spot
