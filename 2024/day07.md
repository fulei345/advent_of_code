# Day 7: Bridge Repairz
We get list of test values and, and a list values which can be put together with operators to get the testvalue
The equations can be validated using a recursive solution that checks all possible combinations
of operators. However the number of states to check grows exponentially as 2ⁿ in part one
and 3ⁿ in part two.

As much faster approach works in reverse from the end of the equation to prune as many states
as possible by checking which operations are possible.

You can also reverse concatanate by dividing by the nearest tenth
## Part 1
In part 1 the operations are only multiplty and add

## Part 2
In part 2 they also add string concatation of the two values
