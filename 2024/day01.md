# Day 1: Historian Hysteria
Our input is two lists of locations, which are a bit diffent.
There are two whitespaces between the numbers

## Part 1
In part 1, we need to find the total difference when they are paired up with the smallest to smallest and largest to largest.
This is done by sorting them and taking the absolute difference

## Part 2
In part 2 we need to multiply the numbers on the left side with how many of them are on the right
This can be done with a hashmap.
The most effecient is probably looping over each N + M and with space equal to M
